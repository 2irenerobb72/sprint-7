cognitive load is the most amount of storage a brain or a computer can have to
be able to function normally.
When I make my website it will have minimal ads because it does distract the
user which is the point of ads. I know from my experience i don't like or trust
websites that have too many ads. Doing that will minimize visual clutter. Also
I would make make sure all the images i have on the page are relevant. I'll use
regular labels so that it won't make the viewer need to learn more.
